                    <p class=" text-[16px] font-[400] mt-[15px]  ">👋 Hi, that's me — Zeeshan. I started DSP CRM back in 2014 while running a video production agency of my own.</p>
                    <p class=" text-[16px] font-[400] mt-[15px]  ">It was a productized service but nobody knew the term back then.</p>
                    <p class=" text-[16px] font-[400] mt-[15px]  ">At the time, we were offering what people now call a productized service, but back then nobody really had a name for it. Clients would choose a service, pay upfront, submit their requirements through a form, and my team would handle everything from there.</p>

            <p class="text-[16px] font-[400] mt-[15px]">For a long time, DSP CRM was just an internal tool I built for myself, along with a few friends who were running similar agencies and struggling with the same problems. They were generous (and brave) enough to help cover some of the development time, even though the solution didn't fully exist yet.</p>
            <p class="text-[16px] font-[400] mt-[15px]">In the early days, you actually had to download a ZIP file and install DSP CRM on your own server. It worked fine at first, but supporting hosting issues quickly became overwhelming.</p>
            <p class="text-[16px] font-[400] mt-[15px]">Fast forward to today, DSP CRM is used and trusted by agencies across SEO, content marketing, video production, and digital services of all kinds. Our users sell millions of dollars in services every single week, all while keeping their teams lean and their working hours reasonable.</p>

                    <p class=" text-[16px] font-[400] mt-[15px]  ">We went on to build a new and improved SaaS version

                    <p class=" text-[16px] font-[400] mt-[15px]  ">Unlike many software companies that rely on outside investment, DSP CRM has always been bootstrapped and profitable from the very beginning. We don't attract users with ultra-cheap plans only to raise prices later, and we're not going to disappear when funding runs out.</p>
                    <p class=" text-[16px] font-[400] mt-[15px]  ">Fast forward to today, Wayfront is used and loved by

That kind of growth means more to us than anything else.</p>
                    <p class=" text-[16px] font-[400] mt-[15px]  ">We're the same way... unlike many of the software
